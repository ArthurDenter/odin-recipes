    <h1>Sweet Potato Casserole with Marshmallows</h1>
    <img src="../images/sweet-potato-casserole.webp" alt="">
    <h5>This sweet potato casserole with marshmallows is creamy, toasty, and delicious! <br>It's a family favorite for
        holidays that you can bake ahead and reheat.</h5>
    <p>This sweet potato casserole with marshmallows toes the line between side dish and dessert â€” and we wouldn't have
        it any other way. Pureed sweet potatoes are blended with sugar and spices, then topped with marshmallows and
        baked to sweet, gooey perfection.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Sweet Potatoes</h3>You'll need about five sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Brown Sugar</h3>Brown sugar is essential to the cozy, toasty, warmth we're after when we make sweet
            potato casserole. Use light for a milder flavor or dark for a more intense flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Margarine</h3>This recipe calls for reduced-fat margarine, but you can substitute regular butter if that's what you have on hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Orange Juice</h3>Three tablespoons of orange juice gives this sweet potato casserole subtle brightness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cinnamon</h3>Just a pinch of cinnamon adds warmth and brings out the other flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Marshmallows</h3>Of course, you'll need a bag of miniature marshmallows (they'll be the star of the show, after all).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Cook and Mash the Sweet Potatoes</h3>Place the peeled and cubed sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, then drain and mash with a potato masher.</li>
        <li><h3>Mix and Top the Casserole</h3>Use an electric mixer to mix the mashed (and cooled) sweet potatoes, brown sugar, margarine, cinnamon, and orange juice. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. Top with marshmallows.</li>
        <li><h3>Bake the Casserole</h3>Bake in a preheated oven until the marshmallows are puffed and lightly browned, about half an hour.</li>
    </ol>
